## Yarn Error

For more info, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/issues/1)

First of all, check that you've got yarn installed correctly - see the [yarn installation docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for more info.

If you're getting an error about scenarios, then you've likely installed the wrong yarn... (you're [not](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821) the only one!). You can fix it by uninstalling, adding the correct repo, and reinstalling, for example, in Debian:
- `sudo apt remove yarn`
- `curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
- `echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list`
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn`

Alternatively, as a workaround, you have several options:
- Try using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) instead: So clone, cd, then run `npm install`, `npm run build` and `npm start`
- Try using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) instead, and all of the system setup and dependencies will already be taken care of. So from within the directory, just run `docker build -t lissy93/dashy .` to build, and then use docker start to run the project, e.g: `docker run -it -p 8080:80 lissy93/dashy` (see the [deploying docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/Deployment.md#deploy-with-docker) for more info)

## `Refused to Connect` in Modal or Workspace View

This is not an issue with Dashy, but instead caused by the target app preventing direct access through embedded elements. It can be fixed by setting the [`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) HTTP header set to `ALLOW [path to Dashy]` or `SAMEORIGIN`, as defined in [RFC-7034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7034). These settings are usually set in the config file for the web server that's hosting the target application, here are some examples of how to enable cross-origin access with common web servers:

### NGINX
In NGINX, you can use the [`add_header`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html) module within the app block.
```
server {
  ...
  add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
}
```
Then reload with `service nginx reload`

### Caddy

In Caddy, you can use the [`header`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/header) directive.

```yaml
header {
  X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
}
```

### Apache

In Apache, you can use the [`mod_headers`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html) module to set the `X-Frame-Options` in your config file. This file is usually located somewhere like `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf

```
Header set X-Frame-Options: "ALLOW-FROM http://[dashy-location]/" 
```
